      <p>Yep, you read that right. My name is Tiia with <span>two</span> 'i's. I know... it's weird, and a bit confusing as to how that might be pronounced but don't worry. It's said the same way as it would be with just one 'i'. </p>
      <p>So let's see... stuff about me. Well, I'm a wife and mother of two beautiful little girls who take up all my time that isn't spent working or hanging out with my husband. Don't get me wrong. I do get a little me time but not a lot but I wouldn't change it for anything.</p>
      <p> I am the Technology Director for AIGA; a nonprofit membership organization for designers. I essentially manage the relationship with our technical partners and developers and oversee all our online assets. I keep things running, or at least work along side those who keep things running.</p>
      <p>Let's see... what else. Hobbies include reading, going out for a drink with friends/husband, traveling, working out (although that's more of a lifestyle, not a hobby), and eating!?! I know that's a necessity but sometimes I really do treat it as a hobby.</p>
      <p>So that's me. Hope you enjoyed learning all about me!</p>
